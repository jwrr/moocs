Agile Meets Design Thinking
===========================

What is Agile?
--------------

* The Manifesto
  * Individuals & Interactions > Processes & Tools
    * 
  * Working Software > Comprehensive Documentation
    * Specs and plans, not customer documentation
  * Customer Collaboration > Contract Negotiation
  * Responding to Change > Following a Plan
    * Replace overly rigid plan with approach to handle ambiguity/uncertainty
    

  * Inter-Disciplinary Collaboration between all members of the team
    * Executive, Product Manager, Project Manager | Designer, Engineering & QA, Sales & Support

  * Focus on:
    * Individuals with testable narratives
    * Frontload value
    * Outcome over Output

Agile for Managers
------------------

* Project Rolls
  * Project Manager
    * Measured on timely-ness and amount of content delivered
    * Agile helps create valuable output that the customer wants

Agile for the Specialists
-------------------------

* Create narratives

Agile 101
---------

* Agile user story
  * As a [persona] I want to [do something] so that I can [derive a reward]
* Stories in Backlogs, Iterations and Releases
  * Stories -> iterations -> Releases
  * Prioritize what stories go into what iteration that go into what release
  * Iteration is usually 2-4 weeks
* Managing Iterations
  * User stories -> Discussion -> Development -> Validation
  * User stories create and share an understanding of what's valuable to the user
* Daily Standup
  * What did I accomplish yesterday?
  * What will I accomplish today?
  * What obstacles are impeding my progress?
  * Focussed on output
* Burndown
  * Effort remaining vs Time remaining
* Methodologies
  * Scrum
    * Are you achieving a good outcome?
  * Extreme Programming (XP)
    * Came before the Agile Manifesto
    * Focussed on coding methodologies extended to project management
  * Kanban
    * Set of methods to reduce work in progress

Today's Best Practices
----------------------

* 1909 - The Principal of Scientific Management
* 1936 - How to Win Friends and Influence People
* 1951 - Death of a Salesman
* 1980 - Competitive Advantage
* 2001 - The Agile Manifesto
* 2005 - Four Steps to the Epiphany
* 2011 - The Lean Startup

* Agile is a practical, inclusive, easy to grasp framework about how to 
  create reliable involation and value through innovative new ideas.

Scale Friendly vs Innovation Friendly
-------------------------------------

* Scale Friendly
  * Planning and Prediction will get you to a good outcome
  * Write a plan because a plan creates certainty and eventually engage with customers
  * 20% success rate
* Innovation Friendly
  * 
* Solution looking for a problem vs Problem looking for a solution

What Makes Agile Hard?
----------------------

* Narrative collaboration -> Experimentation Culture -> Small batches/iterations
* Narrative collaboration allows us to keep our eye on what is important to the user
  in a way that is understandable to the team, so that we have elevated goals that
  constitute what is a valuable outcome.
* We don't always know what is valuable to the use, so we need to try things, 
  instrument observation and react to what we learn.
* Small batches allows us to course correct without going too far down the wrong
  path.

The Blue Button Moment
----------------------

* Diverge and then converge.
* Find the right problem. Then find the right solution
* Blaming vs Examination (why did this happen)

Culture of Experimentation
--------------------------

* Start with idea
* Create Hypothesis
* Experiment design
* Experiment
* Pivot or Persevere
* Persevere when experiments prove hypothesis

* Helps distinguish between Facts, Assumptions and Opinions
* Being Generally Not Wrong vs Being Specifically Right (or Wrong)


A Hypothesis-Driven Approach to Agile
-------------------------------------
* Product Priorities -> Ideas -> Designs -> Execution -> Test -> Deploy   -> Release
                     -> Inferences -> Observations -> Experimental Design 
* Metrics
  * Features with High Engagement / Total Features Released
  * Total Features Released / Sprint
  * Frequency of Releases / Sprint
  
Getting Started with Agile
--------------------------

* Trust the team
* Test Driven Development (TDD)



* What is novel
  * Both inventions are an attempt to understand and enhance what is important
    to the user.
